## Contacts
Source, Drain and substrate (*Body/Bulk*) are ohmic contacts and at equilibrium (no voltage applied and thermal equilibrium) the Fermi energy is uniquely defined:
$$ 
E_{f_{n}}=E_{f_{p}}=E_{f}
$$
When an external voltage ($V_{C}$) is applied to said contacts, the Fermi energy is fixed at the external potential (this means that the voltage applied "sets" the level)
The Fermi energy at thermal equilibrium is set in all the semiconductor connected to the metal contact (source, drain or substrate).
$$
E_{f}= -qV_{C} 
$$
Instead if the voltage is applied **between** two ohmic contacts, the two Fermi energy are shifted one from each other proportionally to the voltage applied:
$$
E_{f_{1}}-E_{f_{2}}=qV
$$
where contact **1** has the lower voltage.
For example if a voltage is applied between *source* and *drain*, with $V_{DS}>0$  the difference in Fermi energies is given by:
$$ 
E_{f_{S}}-E_{f_{D}}=qV_{DS}
$$
